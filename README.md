# Data-Analysis-Code
This project is mainly used for the data analysis course of Grade 21 Statistics (Sino-Foreign joint training course) in GDUFE. The code is derived from R Data Analysis: Methods and Case Details. For those of you who want to take the code, please point a little star at ✨.It will be updated continuously in the future！！！

本项目主要用于广东财经大学21年级统计学(中外联合培训课程)的数据分析课程。代码来源于R数据分析:方法和案例细节。希望拿走代码以及文件的人，可以给一个✨鼓励一下我。后续还会不断更新的！！！

## System and code format
I use a 2023 MacBook Air, the chip is M2 chip, is a Mac system. The code is a.ipynb file, which is the type of Jupyter, which is conducive to data visualization and is very suitable for data analysis. The naming format in the code is almost the same, with R is written in R, with P is written in python.

我用的是2023款的MacBook Air，芯片为M2芯片，是Mac系统。代码为.ipynb文件，也就是Jupyter的类型，这有利于数据可视化，非常适合数据分析。代码文件命名格式几乎相同，带R的就是用R编写的的，带P的就是用python编写的。

## Project origin
In fact, there is no reason to create this pro, just for fun. If you typed it up anyway, you might as well upload it to GitHub and create some academic junk.

其实要创建这个pro也没有啥原因，单纯用来消遣罢了。反正都打出来了，那不如上传到GitHub上，制造一些学术垃圾。

## Project introduction
Running these files requires you to configure Jupyter yourself. I do not use the web version of Jupyter. I use the Jupyter Notebook attached to Visual Studio Code. You can use whichever one you like. For beginners, there may be some problems with configuring Jupyter's kernel, but I am sure you will be able to solve them.
One more thing to say is that I use python venv to run, as for the configuration of venv method is also very simple, you can go to understand.

运行这些文件需要自行配置Jupyter，我并没有使用网页版的Jupyter，我使用的是附加在Visual Studio Code上的Jupyter Notebook。你们喜欢用哪个就用哪个就好了。对于初学者来说，配置Jupyter的内核可能会碰到一些问题，但是我相信你们是可以解决的。
还有一点要说的就是，我使用的是python的venv来进行运行的，至于配置venv的方法也很简单，你们可以去了解一下。
